awk -F ":" '{print $1 $6}' /etc/passwd
	#-F sets the delineator, in other words, how awk recognizes columns from stdout
	
awk 'BEGIN{FS=":"; OFS="-"} {print $1,$6,$7}' /etc/passwd

awk -F "/" '/^\// {print $NF}' /etc/shells 
	#the carrot(^) grabs the beginning of every line, and the '\' escapes the '/' so that awk searches for every line that begins with a slash(/)
	#$NF is the last field of the awk stdout

awk 'length($0) < 8' /etc/shells

awk '$1 ~ /^[b,c]/ {print $0}' .bashrc
	#print every line where the first line is a 'b' or a 'c'
