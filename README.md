Welcome to my personal cybersecurity toolkit.

## [CheatSheets](./CheatSheets)

This directory contains various files including [Maderas' list of necessary cybersecurity skills](./CheatSheets/Get_Started-MaderasSecurityArsenal.md "Maderas Security Arsenal") and [Networking-Basics](./CheatSheets/Networking-Basics/) for learners, and most notably, a [Document](./CheatSheets/Useful-Repositories.md "Tools and Resources") linking to cybersecurity tools and resources. 

Beyond that, you'll find more advanced, technically focused reference guides on specific topics. There's a load of information on common web application vulnerabilities and how to exploit them in [Web-Applications](./CheatSheets/Web-Applications/). I'm also in the process of building a collection of [Power-Commands](./CheatSheets/Power-Commands/) for different scenarios, with the goal of having something for every stage of a pentest.

### [Web-Applications](./CheatSheets/Web-Applications/)
<details><summary>More</summary>
Documents regarding common web application vulnerabilities, including the OWASP Top Ten. Each with code examples or injection payloads. <a href="./CheatSheets/Web-Applications/XSS.md">XSS</a>, <a href="./CheatSheets/Web-Applications/SSRF_bypassFilters.md">SSRF</a>, and <a href="./CheatSheets/Web-Applications/CORS.md">CORS</a> are just a few examples. The <a href="./CheatSheets/Web-Applications/WebApp-ExploitsChecklist.pdf">WebApp Exploit Checklist</a> is a great visual reference.

## [Tools](./Tools)

A collection of my scripts I've found repeated use for in multiple scenarios.

<details><summary>Personal automation scripts</summary>

[`extract_video_audio.py`](./Tools/extract_video_audio.py): CLI tool that creates an MP3 audio file from a MP4 file, or files in a directory.

[`firewall_rules.py`](./Tools/firewall_rules.py): CLI tool that optionally accepts a URL as an argument to download a CSV list of known problematic IP addresses and create block rules for Windows Firewall or `iptables` for Linux. 

> The default URL downloads the "Botnet C2 Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)" from FEODOtracker, which contains "information on tracked botnet c2s but also IP addresses that were acting as a botnet C2 within the **past 30 days**."

[`hashfile_validator.py`](./Tools/hashfile_validator.py): A CLI tool that automatically detects and validates cryptographic hash checksums against files. It supports MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512, with optional JSON output and additional file information. The tool uses Windows' built-in Certutil for hash calculation.

[`https_ngrok_config.yml`](./Tools/https_ngrok_config.yml): A sample configuration file that starts an Ngrok HTTPS endpoint w/ OAuth support.

[`regex_generator.py`](./Tools/RegexGenerator.py): Generates regex patterns to detect keyword variations, including obfuscated and evasive text, for precise matching.

[`repo_structure_visualizer.py`](./Tools/repo_structure_visualizer.py): A Python script that automatically generates an interactive HTML navigation interface for a GitHub repository's directory structure. Adaptable for any repository.

[`Reset-DockerWslIntergration.ps1`](./Tools/Reset-DockerWslIntegration.ps1): PowerShell script that stops Docker Desktop, Stops WSL, and Unregisters the Docker Destop data.
