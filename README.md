# Cybersecurity-References üõ°Ô∏èüîí

Welcome to the a curated collection of cybersecurity resources, tools, and references for people of all skill levels.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

### [Automation](./AutomationScripts)

For automation enthusiasts, this directory contains simple yet powerful scripts for streamlining certain tasks. 

### [References](./References)

This directory contains various files. `git` commands, [search engines for pentesters](./References/Search_Engines_for_Pentesters.jpg), printed cybersecurity blog posts, and power commands using tools like `awk`.

### [Documents](./Documents)

This directory contains a collection of documents that can be useful for cybersecurity professionals. It includes a variety of documents that can be useful for different purposes.

### [UsefulRepositories](./UsefulRepositories)

This is a meta-directory with links to useful cybersecurity-related GitHub repositories. You'll find offensive, defensive, and multi-purpose tools.

Please review the [README](./UsefulRepositories/README.md)

### [Web-Applications](./Web-Applications)
Here you'll find documents for common web application vulnerabilities, like those of the OWASP Top Ten. Each document is different, but all of them contain code examples, injection payloads, that could theoretically be used in the wild. [XSS](./Web-Applications/XSS.md), [SSRF], and [CORS](./Web-Applications/CORS.md) are just a few examples. The [WebApp Exploit Checklist](./Web-Applications/WebApp-ExploitsChecklist.pdf) is a great visual reference.
